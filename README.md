# Executive Summary

The present document shows the undesirable effect of the drug Capomulin as a treatment for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) concerning other therapies. For this, a study was carried out with 249 laboratory mice identified with this SCC tumor’s growth.

In 45 days, the tumor growth was performed and measured in these mice. Analysis groups were conducted to compare Capomuliin with other treatments. There is also a control group (Placebo) to identify Capmulin and the different treatments’ performance.

The performance of this drug was scored based on survival and tumor shrinkage. As shown in the figure “Summary: Number of mice per drug regimen over time,” the Capomulon and Racomilin treatments are the only treatments where the number of mice throughout the analysis period is greater than the control group. In the Capomulin group, 84% of mice survived (Ramicase 80% survived). Likewise, concerning tumor reduction, better performance is observed in the Capomulin and Regimen treatments, as shown in the figure Summary: Average tumor volume per drug Acroos Timepoint Regimen, in relation to the control group. With the Caomulin treatment on average, the tumor volume was reduced by 19.47%; also, the Ramicane group treated with this drug showed a 22.32% reduction.

In general, in the group treated with Capomulin, a decrease in volume is observed; it also has a higher survival number. Considering these two factors, Capomulin is the best performing drug. The biggest competitor is Racimcane, with a behavior similar to Capomulin.
